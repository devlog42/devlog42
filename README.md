Hi, I’m @devlock01 and new to GitHub.  
Intentionally I want to share some of my (python) code as open source.

My current interest is
- python + pyqt

I have some experience in
- Django
- MySQL
- PostgresSQL
- jquery
- Perl

Well, I'm curious about the way awaiting me on GitHub.

<!---
devlock01/devlock01 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
